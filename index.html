			<h2>Data Overview</h2>

			<p>The dataset that I used is created from MAPC’s Zoning Atlas. It provides spatial and tabular data on zoning
				regulations in
				Metro Boston municipalities. It also categorizes zoning into two primary types: <strong>single-family exclusive
					zoning</strong> and <strong>mixed-use or multi-family zoning</strong>. Additionally, it aggregates demographic
				and socioeconomic data from the 2010 US Census and the 2014-2018 American Community Survey.</p>

			<h3>Dataset Structure</h3>
			<p>The dataset contains zoning, demographic, and economic attributes for 101 municipalities in Metro Boston. Each
				municipality has two potential rows: one for single-family zoning and one for other housing types. Key fields
				include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>muni_id</strong> - Unique identifier for each municipality.</li>
				<li><strong>muni</strong> - Municipality name.</li>
				<li><strong>only_single_family</strong> - Indicates whether the zoning is exclusive to single-family homes (1)
					or allows other housing types (0).</li>
				<li><strong>%_single_family</strong> - Percentage of residential land dedicated to single-family zoning.</li>
				<li><strong>is_MBTA_community</strong> - Indicates if the municipality is part of the MBTA Communities Act (1 =
					Yes, 0 = No).</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Demographic & Socioeconomic Fields</h3>
			<p>Aggregated from Census data, the dataset includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>pop</strong> - Total population.</li>
				<li><strong>pop_u18</strong> - Population under 18 years.</li>
				<li><strong>pop_18_64</strong> - Population aged 18-64 years.</li>
				<li><strong>pop_65o</strong> - Population 65 and over.</li>
				<li><strong>nhwhi, nhaa, nhas, lat</strong> - Racial composition data (Non-Hispanic White, Black, Asian,
					Hispanic/Latino).</li>
				<li><strong>hh</strong> - Total households.</li>
				<li><strong>Income Brackets</strong> - Household income distribution, from < $10,000 to> $200,000.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Data Quality Assessment</h3>
			<p>A thorough review of the dataset reveals the following potential data quality issues:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Missing Data for Small Zoning Areas</strong>: Some small municipalities may have incomplete zoning
					or demographic data, especially in cases where zoning boundaries do not align perfectly with census block
					groups.</li>
				<li><strong>Data Aggregation Impact</strong>: Since each municipality has two rows (one for single-family zoning
					and one for other housing types), summing percentages incorrectly could lead to values over 100%, requiring
					careful aggregation.</li>
				<li><strong>Unexpected 0% Single-Family Zoning</strong>: Some cities, such as Boston and Somerville, are
					reported as having 0% single-family zoning. However, we know these areas contain single-family homes. This may
					indicate that the dataset omits small single-family zones or that calculations for zoning proportions require
					adjustments.</li>
				<li><strong>Year Discrepancies</strong>: Census demographic data is from 2010, while income data is from
					2014-2018. The dataset does not account for changes over time, which could impact the accuracy of
					affordability analysis.</li>
				<li><strong>Land Area Availability</strong>: The dataset does not explicitly provide the total land area for
					each municipality’s zoning categories, which may require further calculations to assess density accurately.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Overall, this dataset provides a rich source of information for analyzing zoning regulations and their effects
				on housing supply, affordability, and demographics. However, careful handling of data aggregation, missing
				values, and unexpected results (such as 0% single-family zoning for some cities) is necessary to ensure accurate
				analysis.</p>

			<h2>Subtheme: Zoning and Housing Supply</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>How do zoning restrictions vary across Metro Boston municipalities, and which towns have the most
						exclusionary zoning?</strong></li>
				<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> My family lives in Medford, where most homes are single-family residences, and I
					am curious to see how other towns—such as Cambridge, Somerville, Newton, and Boston—compare in terms of zoning
					regulations. Are these areas similarly restrictive, or do some allow for more diverse housing types, such as
					multi-family buildings and apartments? The <em>City Observatory</em> article on Somerville noted that only 22
					existing buildings would comply with modern zoning laws, raising the question of how common such restrictive
					policies are across Metro Boston.</p>
				<p><strong>Sources:</strong> "The Illegal City of Somerville" (City Observatory), Metro Boston zoning dataset
				</p>

				<li><strong>How do zoning regulations impact the supply and affordability of housing in Metro Boston?</strong>
				</li>
				<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> The housing market is highly dynamic according to our family buying the house
					years ago.
					The same house can have very different price offers in different times and under different circumstances.
					I want to explore how zoning restrictions affect supply and demand. Given the high cost of housing in Boston,
					does restrictive zoning
					contribute to a housing shortage, making homes less affordable? Additionally, who are the typical buyers in
					Boston, and do current zoning policies align with the housing needs of residents? The <em>Affordable Homes
						Act</em> states that Massachusetts needs 200,000 more housing units by 2030, suggesting that current zoning
					laws might be a major barrier to achieving this goal.</p>
				<p><strong>Sources:</strong> Affordable Homes Act, "Minneapolis Land Use Reforms Offer a Blueprint for Housing
					Affordability"</p>

				<li><strong>What proportion of existing buildings in Metro Boston do not comply with current zoning laws, and
						what does this reveal about the rigidity of zoning regulations?</strong></li>
				<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> The <em>Somerville zoning study</em> found that the vast majority of buildings
					would be illegal under current zoning laws. This raises the question of whether other towns also have high
					rates of non-compliant properties, indicating that zoning laws may be outdated or overly restrictive.
					Understanding how many existing buildings wouldn’t be allowed today could provide a data-driven argument for
					zoning reform, particularly against common pushbacks like preserving “historical character” or avoiding
					“overcrowding.”</p>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="./1.png" alt="Land Zones Exclusive for Single-Family Housing by Municipality"
					style="width: 96%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
					<strong>Percentage of Land Zoned Exclusively for Single-Family Housing by Municipality</strong><br>
					This bar chart visualizes the percentage of land exclusively zoned for single-family housing across
					municipalities in Metro Boston. The data reveals stark zoning disparities, with some municipalities (e.g.,
					Weston, Waban, Hopkinton) having nearly 100% of their residential land dedicated to single-family homes, while
					others (e.g., Boston, Cambridge, Chelsea, Somerville) have close to 0% single-family zoning.<br><br>

					One key insight is that suburban municipalities tend to have more restrictive zoning, favoring single-family
					homes over multi-family or mixed-use housing. This aligns with historical trends of exclusionary zoning
					policies, which have contributed to low population density, high housing costs, and limited housing supply in
					these areas. Conversely, urban municipalities with high population densities have more flexible zoning laws
					that allow for a mix of housing types.<br><br>

					<strong>Follow-up Questions:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Why do some municipalities have 100% single-family zoning while others have close to 0%?
							<ul>
								<li>What historical or policy-driven factors led to this stark contrast?</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>How does population density compare across municipalities with different zoning policies?</li>
						<li>How has zoning changed over time in these municipalities?</li>
					</ul>

					This initial basic visualization raises important questions about housing affordability, population density,
					and zoning
					reform in Metro Boston. If municipalities with high single-family zoning do not adapt, they may struggle to
					meet growing housing demand and affordability goals.

				<img src="./2.png" alt="Scatter Plot of % Exclusive Single-Family Zoning on Population Across Metro Boston"
					style="width: 95%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
					<strong>Scatter Plot of % Exclusive Single-Family Zoning on Population Across Metro Boston</strong><br>
					This scatter plot examines the relationship between the percentage of land exclusively zoned for single-family
					housing and total population across Metro Boston municipalities. The chart suggests a negative correlation
					between single-family zoning and population—municipalities with high single-family zoning percentages
					generally have lower total populations, while cities with more flexible zoning (e.g., Boston and Malden) tend
					to accommodate much larger populations.<br><br>

					Key Insights:
					<ul>
						<li>Municipalities such as Weston, Wenham, and Nahant have 100% single-family zoning but relatively small
							populations.</li>
						<li>Cities like Boston, Malden, and Medway have low single-family zoning percentages and significantly
							larger populations.</li>
						<li>Many towns clustered at high single-family zoning percentages appear to have lower population figures,
							suggesting that restrictive zoning policies may contribute to lower housing density.</li>
						<li>However, there are some outliers, such as Salem, which has a mid-range population despite a relatively
							high single-family zoning percentage.</li>
					</ul>

					<strong>Follow-up Questions:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Is there any causal relationship between a town having low/high population and having small/large
							proportion of land exclusive for single-family housing? If so, which causes which?</li>
						<li>Are municipalities with high single-family zoning percentages also experiencing higher home prices and
							limited rental availability?</li>
						<li>How do zoning regulations interact with economic factors such as median household income and
							homeownership rates?</li>
					</ul>

					The findings from this visualization reinforce the idea that zoning regulations might have effects on
					housing supply and population density. If municipalities with restrictive zoning continue limiting housing
					development, they may struggle to accommodate future population growth and housing demand.

				<figcaption>
					<strong>Treemap of Percentage of Households with Income Over $100K by Municipality</strong><br>
					This treemap visualizes the percentage of households earning over $100,000 across Metro Boston municipalities.
					The size of each block represents the relative proportion of high-income households in that
					municipality.<br><br>

					Key Insights:
					<ul>
						<li>Some towns, such as Needham, Shernborn, and Sherborn, have a high percentage of households earning over
							$100K, reflecting their affluent demographics.</li>
						<li>Suburban towns generally show a higher concentration of high-income households, while populated cities
							like Boston
							and Everett have smaller proportions of wealthy households.</li>
					</ul>

					<strong>Follow-up Questions:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>How does the percentage of high-income households correlate with zoning policies (single-family vs.
							mixed zoning)?</li>
					</ul>

					As a deeper step to probe the relationship between income and housing policies, this visualization underscores
					the economic disparities in Metro Boston and raises important questions about
					income-based housing segregation. Further analysis can help identify whether zoning laws and housing policies
					contribute to these economic divides.

				<figcaption>
					<strong>Scatter Plot of % of Households Earning Over $100K vs. % Single-Family Zoning by
						Municipality</strong><br>
					This scatter plot explores the relationship between the percentage of households earning over $100K and the
					percentage of land zoned exclusively for single-family housing across Metro Boston municipalities. The trend
					line suggests a positive correlation, indicating that municipalities with a higher proportion of single-family
					zoning tend to have a greater share of high-income households.<br><br>

					Key Insights:
					<ul>
						<li>Municipalities with close to 100% single-family zoning, such as Weston, Lincoln, and Sherborn, have a
							high percentage of households earning over $100K.</li>
						<li>Conversely, cities with lower single-family zoning percentages, such as Chelsea, Revere, and Gloucester,
							tend to have a lower share of high-income households.</li>
						<li>The trend line suggests that restrictive zoning may contribute to income segregation, reinforcing
							economic disparities by limiting access to more affordable housing options.</li>
						<li>There are some outliers, such as Watertown and Beverly, which has a high percentage of high-income
							households despite
							not having the highest single-family zoning rate.</li>
					</ul>

					<strong>Follow-up Questions:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Is there a direct causal relationship between restrictive zoning policies and income segregation, or are
							there other influencing factors such as school districts and property taxes?</li>
						<li>How do home prices compare across municipalities with different levels of single-family zoning?</li>
						<li>Are municipalities with high-income households also experiencing greater resistance to zoning reform?
						</li>
						<li>What role does access to public transportation play in shaping the income distribution of municipalities
							with lower single-family zoning rates?</li>
					</ul>

					Figure 4 suggests to us that zoning policies may reinforce economic divisions, potentially limiting
					housing accessibility for lower-income families in areas dominated by single-family zoning. Further
					investigation into housing affordability and policy interventions could provide deeper insights into solutions
					for more equitable housing development.

					style="width: 96%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
					<strong>Proportion of Population Aged 65 and Over by Municipality</strong><br>
					This bar chart highlights the percentage of residents aged 65 and older across Metro Boston municipalities.
					Aging populations have distinct housing needs, including access to senior-friendly housing, healthcare
					facilities, and public transportation.<br><br>

					Key Insights:
					<ul>
						<li>Municipalities such as Medford, Somerville, and Quincy have the highest proportions of elderly
							residents.</li>
						<li>Some suburban towns with restrictive zoning policies may struggle to provide adequate senior housing
							options, potentially leading to displacement.</li>
						<li>Through comparing with figure 1 and figure 3, we can find that top towns with elder population tend to
							be listed on top in terms of household incoming of over 100k and relatively low restriction on land
							exclusive for single-family house (like Medford and Quincy). Our initial hypothesis without further causal
							analysis for this phenomenon is that in the Metro Boston area, the elder population likes to live in
							wealthier neighborhood because they tend to have more savings. Moreover, elder population prefers to live
							in suburban areas because they care much less for transportation and likes living in more seclusive parts
							of the city </li>
					</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="./6.png" alt="Proportion of Population Aged 65 and Over by Municipality"
					style="width: 96%; height: auto;" />
				<figcaption>
					<strong>Proportion of Population Under Age 18 and Over Age 65 by Municipality</strong><br>
					This bar chart presents the proportion of residents who are either over 18 and and 65 across Metro Boston
					municipalities. These two age groups often have distinct housing needs and can influence local zoning policies
					and public resource allocation.<br><br>

					Key Insights:
					<ul>
						<li>Municipalities such as Winthrop, Weymouth, and Ashland have the highest proportions of residents in the
							18-65 age group, indicating that these areas may have a relatively lower number of dependent populations
							(children and seniors) compared to other municipalities. Since the 18-65 population generally consists of
							working professionals and families in their prime earning years, the economic activity and housing demand
							in these areas may differ from municipalities with higher proportions of children or retirees.
							Interestingly, these towns remain relatively more affordable, according to Zillow, despite having less
							developed public transportation and fewer public amenities compared to areas with a more balanced or aging
							population.

							One hypothesis is that these municipalities may have zoning policies that favor single-family housing and
							lower population density, making housing prices more stable and affordable for middle-income earners but
							potentially limiting opportunities for younger professionals or lower-income workers to move in.
							Additionally, the concentration of working-age residents may also indicate fewer retirement communities or
							limited senior housing options, discouraging older adults from staying in these areas as they age. Future
							research could explore whether more mixed-use developments and transit-oriented housing in these towns
							could improve affordability and public infrastructure while supporting a growing working-age population.
						</li>
					</ul>

					This visualization suggests that municipalities with high percentages of youth and elderly populations may
					have specific housing and infrastructure needs that should be considered in zoning reform discussions.

			<h2>Summary & Conclusion</h2>

			<p>
				This exploratory analysis of zoning regulations, income distribution, and demographic trends in Metro Boston
				municipalities highlights key insights into how zoning policies shape economic and social structures. The
				findings
				suggest that municipalities with restrictive single-family zoning tend to have higher household incomes, lower
				population densities, and a greater concentration of elderly residents. In contrast, municipalities with more
				flexible
				zoning policies exhibit greater economic and demographic diversity, with higher population densities and a
				broader
				range of income levels.
			</p>

			<p>
				One of the most striking patterns observed is the correlation between exclusionary zoning and economic
				segregation.
				Municipalities that dedicate a high percentage of their residential land to single-family homes often exhibit
				higher
				median household incomes and a lack of affordable housing options. This supports the hypothesis that restrictive
				zoning
				policies contribute to wealth concentration and reduced housing accessibility for lower-income and younger
				residents.
			</p>

			<p>
				Additionally, the analysis of age distribution across municipalities suggests that zoning laws may inadvertently
				influence where different age groups reside. Municipalities with higher proportions of elderly residents often
				have
				more single-family zoning, potentially limiting housing options for younger professionals and families.
				Conversely,
				areas with higher working-age populations tend to have more mixed-use or multi-family housing, possibly due to
				better
				job accessibility and transit-oriented development.
			</p>

			<p>
				These insights raise important questions for future research and policy discussions. Should zoning laws be
				reformed
				to promote greater housing diversity and affordability? How can municipalities balance the need to preserve
				neighborhood
				character while ensuring equitable access to housing? Further analysis of housing costs, public transportation
				access,
				and legislative efforts could provide additional guidance on potential policy reforms.
			</p>

			<p>
				Overall, we can see the need for data-driven decision-making in Metro Boston's urban planning. If municipalities
				in
				Metro Boston seek to address housing affordability and socioeconomic segregation, better zoning reform should be
				a
				critical
				component of their strategy.
